//Whilst not a dependancy, it is best to have the /var/www directory owned by the www-data:www-data user:group.
//chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
//can be used to achieve this.

The directory for the certifiate store must be writeable by the apache user.
I have removed the requirement for the apache user to write the setup file as it is a vulnerability. You can paste the updated setup.php into the setup.php file
once you have run the install. If you wish you can set the include folder writeable by the apache user for setup but I recommend changing that ASAP.


It is advised that /var/www/phpca be the root folder for your phpca website and /var/www/certstore be your folder location for the certificates.
That way, www-data can write to the certstore, without it being directly accessible via the webserver, but only via php code accessible via /var/www/phpca

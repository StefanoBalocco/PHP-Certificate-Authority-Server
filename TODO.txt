1) update code
2) convert to bootstrap and fontawesome
3) create user profiles for requesting and signing
    a) Trusted agent can submit
    b) Registration Authority can signing
4) create PKI certificates

5) final version will not include local versions of bootstrap

Possibly sort out the framework for RADIUS Authentication, but not worried about it at the moment
